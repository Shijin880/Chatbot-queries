This project is an interactive AI chatbot designed to assist learners in understanding scientific theories across various domains. Built using OpenAI's GPT model and Gradio, the chatbot provides natural-language conversations for educational purposes.

📌 Features
🤖 Interactive chatbot interface

📚 Domain-specific knowledge in scientific theories

🧠 Powered by OpenAI GPT (via API key)



📄 Prompt engineering for tailored answers

🏗️ Project Structure
Prompt Engineering: A base prompt is crafted to instruct the chatbot to behave like an expert tutor in scientific theories.

OpenAI API: The chatbot queries the OpenAI GPT model to generate responses.

Gradio UI: The interface is built with Gradio to allow easy interaction via browser.
1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

bash
Copy
